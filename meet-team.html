        <h1>Software Team</h1>
        <p>The software team is essential for crafting and refining the algorithms that govern the droneâ€™s navigation and operational behaviors. This team develops the drone's "brain," which includes systems for flight control, route planning, communications, and autonomous decision-making. They ensure precise real-time data integration from sensors and cameras, crucial for environmental sensing and obstacle avoidance. Cybersecurity is also a key responsibility, safeguarding the communication links between drones and control systems against potential threats. Collaboration with the hardware team is vital to ensure that the software performs optimally on the specified hardware. Through rigorous testing, the software team ensures reliability and safety in all operational conditions, aiming to enable the drones to autonomously, efficiently, and safely complete delivery tasks.</p>
